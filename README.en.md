# A Tour of Life (Pyrad Notes!)

   ## Description

   This is a notebook for Pyrad. 

   It's old name is *Pyrad's Notes*, and it was originally created on **Gitee**, and all kinds of useful notes are kept down here to remind me of something interesting. Yes, all kinds.

   I changed the name to **A Tour of Life** from **Pyrad Notes!**, as I think it's the time to find a place keep down all things over my mind, and to find a way to track my life. Perhaps good, perhaps bad.

   All notes are organized by Sphinx + markdown texts, and the web pages are built with help of **ReadTheDocs**.
