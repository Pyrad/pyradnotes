# A Tour of Life (Pyrad Notes!)

## NOTE

This should be ***exactly*** the same for the 2 repositories from 2 different remote:

- Gitee - [Pyrad/pyradnotes](https://gitee.com/pyrad/pyradnotes)
- Github - [Pyrad/pyradnotes](https://github.com/Pyrad/pyradnotes)

Check the following pages to see how to set multiple remote origins on a same local repo:

## Description

This is a notebook for Pyrad. 

It's old name is *Pyrad's Notes*, and it was originally created on **Gitee**, and all kinds of useful notes are kept down here to remind me of something interesting. Yes, all kinds.

I changed the name to **A Tour of Life** from **Pyrad Notes!**, as I think it's the time to find a place keep down all things over my mind, and to find a way to track my life. Perhaps good, perhaps bad.

All notes are organized by Sphinx + markdown texts, and the web pages are built with help of **ReadTheDocs**.
